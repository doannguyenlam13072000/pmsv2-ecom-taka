# Testing

## Junior Level Questions

### 1. Basics of Testing

- [x] What is software testing, and why is it important?
  - Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify and fix defects, ensure quality, and verify it meets user requirements.
  - It is important because it enhances software reliability(tin cậy), prevents costly bugs, and improves user satisfaction(sự hài long) by delivering a high-quality product.

- [x] What are the differences between manual and automated testing?

    |Manual Testing | Automated Testing|
    |-------------------------------------------|------------------|
    |Performed by humans without tools.         | Uses tools/scripts to execute tests.|
    |Time-consuming(Tốn) and prone to errors(Dễ mắc lỗi).     | Faster and more accurate.|
    |Suitable for exploratory/ad-hoc tests.     | Ideal for repetitive or regression tests.|
    |No upfront cost for tools.                 | Requires investment in tools/scripts.|

- [x] Explain the terms unit test, integration test, and end-to-end (E2E) test.
  - `Unit Test:` Tests individual components or functions in isolation. Example: Testing a single API function.
  - `Integration Test:` Verifies interactions between integrated modules. Example: Testing API calls with the database.
  - `End-to-End (E2E) Test:` Simulates real user workflows across the entire system. Example: Testing a login flow from the UI to the database.

### 2. Unit Testing

- [x] What is unit testing, and when should it be used?
  - Unit testing involves(liên quan đến) testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to verify they work as expected. It should be used:

    - During development to catch bugs early.
    - For critical or complex code to ensure reliability.
    - When refactoring, to ensure no regressions occur.
    - Example: Testing a function that calculates the square of a number.

- [x] How would you test a simple function that adds two numbers?

    ```typescript
        // add.ts
        export const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;

        // add.test.ts
        import { add } from './add';

        test('adds 2 + 3 to equal 5', () => {
            expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
        });

        test('adds -1 + 1 to equal 0', () => {
            expect(add(-1, 1)).toBe(0);
        });
    ```

- [x] What is the purpose of assertions in testing?
  - Assertions are used to compare the actual output of code to the expected result. They ensure the test fails if the output doesn’t meet expectations, providing clear feedback.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- [x] What is E2E testing, and why is it important?
  - End-to-End (E2E) testing validates the entire application flow from the user's perspective, simulating real-world scenarios. It ensures all components—frontend, backend, APIs, and databases—work together as expected.
  - Importance:
    - Detects issues across integrated systems.
    - Verifies critical user workflows like login or checkout.
    - Builds confidence in application reliability before deployment.

- [x] Can you name some tools used for E2E testing (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium)?
  - Cypress: Fast, modern, and great for UI and API testing.
  - Playwright: Reliable, supports multiple browsers, and is developer-friendly.
  - Selenium: Widely used for browser-based automation.
  - Puppeteer: Node.js library for controlling Chrome/Chromium.
  - TestCafe: Easy-to-use and supports modern browsers.

- [x] How would you test the login functionality of a web application?
  - Cypress example

    ```javascript
        describe('Login Functionality', () => {
            it('should log in with valid credentials', () => {
                cy.visit('/login'); // Navigate to the login page
                cy.get('#username').type('testuser'); // Enter username
                cy.get('#password').type('password123'); // Enter password
                cy.get('#login-button').click(); // Click the login button
                cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard'); // Verify redirection to dashboard
                cy.contains('Welcome, testuser').should('be.visible'); // Check for welcome message
            });

            it('should show an error for invalid credentials', () => {
                cy.visit('/login');
                cy.get('#username').type('invaliduser');
                cy.get('#password').type('wrongpassword');
                cy.get('#login-button').click();
                cy.contains('Invalid username or password').should('be.visible');
            });
        });
    ```

## Mid-Level Questions

### 1. Testing Strategy

- [x] What is the difference between white-box testing and black-box testing?
  - White-box Testing: This is a testing approach where the tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the application (source code, logic, etc.). It focuses on testing the logic of the system, including functions, algorithms, and internal pathways. It’s often used for unit tests and code coverage analysis.
    - Example: Testing the internal methods of a class or checking edge cases in a function.
  - Black-box Testing: In black-box testing, the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system. The focus is solely on the inputs and outputs. It tests the functionality of the software without knowledge of how it’s implemented, typically used for functional testing.
    - Example: Verifying if a login form correctly accepts valid/invalid user credentials.

- [x] How do you decide what to test and what not to test in a project?
  - What to Test:
    - Critical functionality: Features that are essential to the core operation of the application (e.g., payment processing, authentication).
    - Complex logic: Functions or modules with intricate logic or algorithms.
    - User-facing components: Interfaces or flows that directly affect the user experience.
    - High-risk areas: Parts of the code that are more prone to bugs or have been frequently modified.
    - Regression areas: Features that have been recently refactored or updated.

  - What Not to Test:
    - Third-party services: External APIs or services should be mocked or stubbed in tests, as they are tested separately.
    - Non-critical paths: Code with very low usage or features that do not impact the user experience directly.
    - Trivial(Tầm thường) code: Simple getters, setters, or functions with no business logic might not need dedicated tests.

- [x] What is a test pyramid? Explain its levels and their purpose.
  - The test pyramid is a concept that describes the ideal distribution of tests in terms of scope and cost. It encourages having more low-level tests and fewer high-level tests to achieve a balance between speed and coverage.
  - Base level (Unit tests):
    - Purpose: To test individual components or functions in isolation.
    - Characteristics: Fast, low cost, and high coverage. The base of the pyramid should have the most tests (e.g., testing functions, methods, or small units of code).
    - Example: Unit tests for individual functions, classes, or APIs.

  - Middle level (Integration tests):
    - Purpose: To test how different modules interact with each other, ensuring that the components work as expected when integrated.
    - Characteristics: Slower than unit tests, but still manageable. Tests interaction between units like databases, services, or APIs.
    - Example: Testing API routes, database interactions, or the flow of data between services.

  - Top level (End-to-End or UI tests):
    - Purpose: To test the entire system’s functionality and user workflows from start to finish.
    - Characteristics: Slower, more expensive, and should be kept minimal. E2E tests simulate real user behavior and verify that the system works as a whole.
    - Example: Testing the login process, checkout flow, or multi-step user tasks.

### 2. Mocking and Spying

- [x] What is mocking in testing? Why is it used?
  - Mocking is a technique in testing where you replace real implementations of functions, objects, or modules with controlled versions to isolate the code being tested. This allows you to simulate different behaviors of dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases) and focus on testing the logic of the component in isolation.
  - Why it’s used:
    - Isolation: Ensures the test environment is isolated from external dependencies, preventing tests from failing due to factors like network issues.
    - Control: Allows simulating specific conditions (e.g., API responses, errors) without relying on external systems.
    - Speed: Makes tests faster by not needing real API calls or database operations.

- [x] How would you mock an API call in a test?
  - Using Jest and jest.mock(), you can mock an API call in your test. Here's an example:

    ```javascript
        // api.js - Function to fetch data
        export const fetchData = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        return response.json();
        };

        // api.test.js - Test file
        import { fetchData } from './api';

        jest.mock('fetch', () => jest.fn()); // Mock fetch globally

        test('should mock API call', async () => {
        // Setup mock to return a specific value
        fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({
            json: () => Promise.resolve({ message: 'Success' }),
        });

        const data = await fetchData();
        expect(data.message).toBe('Success');
        expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
        });
    ```

- [x] What is the difference between a spy and a mock?
  - Spy:
    - A spy is a function that records information about its calls (e.g., arguments, return values), but it still calls the original function. It’s typically used to verify that a function was called or to track its behavior.
    - Example: Tracking calls to a method without changing its behavior.

  - Mock:
    - A mock function is a function that you create to replace the original implementation entirely. It can be configured to simulate specific behavior (e.g., return values, errors) and is used to isolate code in tests.
    - Example: Simulating a database query or network request without calling the actual database/API.

  - Key Differences:
    - Spy: Observes(quan sát) the behavior of the original function and allows it to run as normal.
    - Mock: Replaces the original function and controls its behavior during the test.

### 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- [x] What is the purpose of running tests in a CI/CD workflow?
  - Running tests in a CI/CD workflow ensures that code is automatically validated before it is merged or deployed. The main purposes are:
    - `Automated validation:` Tests are run automatically with every change, ensuring new code doesn’t introduce bugs or regressions.
        -`Faster feedback:` Developers get immediate feedback about their changes, helping to catch issues early in the development process.
    - `Quality assurance:` Running tests in the pipeline ensures the overall quality of the codebase and guarantees that the application behaves as expected across different environments.
    - `Consistency:` CI/CD ensures that tests are run consistently on every change, preventing situations where code is merged without being tested properly.
    - `Reliability:` CI/CD pipelines automate the testing and deployment process, reducing human error and ensuring that only working code is deployed to production.

### 4. Coverage and Metrics

- [x] What is test coverage, and how is it measured?
  - Test coverage refers to the percentage of the codebase that is covered by automated tests. It is a metric used to evaluate the extent to which the application is being tested, helping developers identify untested parts of the code.
  - Test coverage is typically measured by tools that analyze the codebase and check which lines, branches, or paths of the code are executed during the test run. The metric is generally represented as a percentage, indicating how much of the code is tested.
  - For example:
    - 100% test coverage means that all the code in the project has been tested by at least one test case.
  - Coverage tools track how many lines of code or branches are executed while running the tests and compare this to the total lines of code to generate the coverage report.

- [x] What are the common types of coverage metrics (e.g., branch, statement, line)?
  - Line Coverage:
    - Measures how many lines of code have been executed during the tests.
    - Metric: The percentage of lines covered by tests relative to the total lines in the code.
    - Limitation: It does not account for whether all possible outcomes of a line (e.g., branches) are tested.

  - Branch Coverage:
    - Measures whether each possible branch (e.g., if or else conditions) has been tested.
    - Metric: The percentage of executed branches relative to the total possible branches.
    - Limitation: Branch coverage may not ensure that all paths are fully tested, as some complex logic may still have untested combinations.

  - Statement Coverage:
    - Similar to line coverage but focused on individual statements (e.g., function calls or assignments).
    - Metric: The percentage of statements that have been executed during tests.

  - Path Coverage:
    - Measures whether all possible execution paths in the program have been tested. It considers combinations of branches and loops.
    - Metric: The percentage of paths covered relative to the total possible execution paths.
    - Limitation: Achieving 100% path coverage can be difficult, especially for complex systems.

  - Condition Coverage:
    - Focuses on whether each boolean condition in the program has been evaluated both to true and false.
    - Metric: The percentage of conditions covered.
    - Limitation: This does not always account for the entire path or branch logic.
