# Webpack

## Junior Level Questions

### 2. Entry, Output, and Loaders

- [ ] What is the purpose of the entry property in Webpack?
  - The entry property in Webpack defines the starting point(s) of the application. It's where Webpack begins the bundling process to create a dependency graph. You can specify a single file or an array of files (for multiple entry points) as the entry point. Webpack uses these entry points to figure out which files to include in the final bundle.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        entry: {
            main: './src/index.js',
            admin: './src/admin.js',
        },
    };
    ```

- [ ] What is the output property used for in Webpack?
  - The output property specifies where and how the bundled files should be stored. It defines the location and the naming convention for the output files, including the file name, path, and whether to use hashing for cache busting(phá bộ nhớ đệm).

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        output: {
            filename: '[name].bundle.js', // [name] will be replaced with the entry point names (e.g., main.bundle.js)
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
    };
    ```

- [ ] What are Webpack loaders? Give examples of commonly used loaders.
  - Webpack loaders are transformations that are applied to files before they are bundled by Webpack. They allow Webpack to process files that are not JavaScript, such as CSS, images, TypeScript, or JSX, by transforming them into valid modules that can be included in the bundle.
  - Some commonly used loaders:
    - `babel-loader`: Transforms JavaScript files (including JSX or TypeScript) using Babel to ensure compatibility with different browsers.
    - `style-loader` and `css-loader`: `css-loader` processes CSS files and resolves imports, while `style-loader` injects the styles into the HTML page.
    - `file-loader`: Handles file imports like images and fonts, emitting them into the output directory and returning a URL.
    - `ts-loader`: Transforms TypeScript files into JavaScript.

### 3. Plugins

- [ ] What is a Webpack plugin? How is it different from a loader?
  - A Webpack plugin is a tool used to extend Webpack's functionality and to perform tasks that Webpack's core system does not cover, such as optimizing bundles, managing assets, or injecting environment variables. Plugins can hook into various stages of the Webpack build process to perform tasks like code minification, tree-shaking, or adding meta-information to the final output.
  - Difference between a Loader and a Plugin:
    - Loaders: Process and transform files before they are bundled. They are used to convert files (e.g., from TypeScript to JavaScript or SCSS to CSS).
    - Plugins: Extend Webpack's capabilities and work on a higher level, typically modifying the build process as a whole (e.g., minification, environment variable substitution, code splitting).
  - In short, loaders are for transforming individual files, while plugins work on the entire build process.

- [ ] Name a few commonly used Webpack plugins and their purposes (e.g., HtmlWebpackPlugin, DefinePlugin).
  - `HtmlWebpackPlugin`: Automatically generates an index.html file and injects the output files (e.g., JavaScript and CSS) into it.
  - `DefinePlugin`: Allows you to define global constants that can be replaced at compile time. Useful for setting environment variables (e.g., process.env.NODE_ENV).
  - `MiniCssExtractPlugin`: Extracts CSS into separate files instead of embedding them in the JavaScript bundle. This is useful for production environments to improve loading time.
  - `TerserPlugin`: Minifies JavaScript code to reduce bundle size in production.

### 4. Development Basics

- [ ] What is the purpose of webpack-dev-server?
  - `webpack-dev-server` is a development server that provides live reloading or hot module replacement (HMR) during development. It watches for changes in your source code and automatically rebuilds the bundle, making it easy to see changes without needing to refresh the page manually.
  - Key features of webpack-dev-server:
    - Live Reloading: The page reloads automatically when you make changes to the code.
    - Hot Module Replacement (HMR): It only updates the changed modules, without reloading the whole page, offering a faster development experience.

- [ ] What does the mode property in Webpack do?
  - he mode property in Webpack specifies the build environment and determines how Webpack will optimize the build process. It has three possible values:
    - `development`: Enables features that improve the developer experience, like detailed error messages, unminified code, and source maps for debugging.
    - `production`: Optimizes the build for performance. It enables optimizations like minification, tree shaking, and scope hoisting to reduce the final bundle size.
    - `none`: Disables built-in optimizations. You can control every part of the build process manually.

## Mid-Level Questions

### 1. Advanced Loaders

- [ ] Explain the purpose of the babel-loader. When would you use it?
  - `babel-loader` is a Webpack loader that transpiles JavaScript code written in modern ECMAScript (ES6+), JSX, or TypeScript to older versions of JavaScript (such as ES5). This ensures that the code can run across a wide range of browsers, especially those that do not support the latest JavaScript features. It uses Babel, a JavaScript compiler, to perform this transformation.
  - When to use babel-loader:
    - ES6+ to ES5: To convert modern JavaScript syntax (like arrow functions, template literals, async/await, etc.) into code that older browsers can understand.
    - JSX to JavaScript: For React applications, where JSX (HTML-like syntax) needs to be converted into standard JavaScript.
    - TypeScript to JavaScript: If you are using TypeScript, Babel can transpile TypeScript to JavaScript.

- [ ] How do you handle CSS files in Webpack using css-loader and style-loader?
  - css-loader and style-loader are Webpack loaders used for processing and injecting CSS into the JavaScript bundle.
    - css-loader: It interprets @import and url() statements in CSS files and resolves them. It also handles CSS modules and transforms the CSS into JavaScript, so it can be bundled.
    - style-loader: It injects the CSS into the`<style>` tag in the HTML document. This is typically used in development, as it enables fast live reloading without reloading the page.

  - To use both loaders together:
    - css-loader processes the CSS.
    - style-loader injects the CSS into the DOM.

- [ ] What is the purpose of file-loader and url-loader?  How are they different?
  - Both file-loader and url-loader are used for handling asset files like images, fonts, and other binary files in Webpack. They help include these assets in the bundle and manage their paths.
  - `file-loader:`
    - It moves the asset to the output directory and returns the URL to that asset.
    - The file is processed and emitted to the final output folder (e.g., dist/images/image.png).
  - `url-loader`:
    - It works similarly to file-loader, but instead of moving the asset to a file, it can convert small assets (e.g., images, fonts) into base64-encoded URLs that are embedded directly in the JavaScript or CSS file.
    - This is useful for small assets to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
  - Key Difference:
    - `file-loader` always emits the file to the output directory and provides the URL.
    - `url-loader` can base64-encode small files into the JavaScript/CSS bundle, reducing the number of HTTP requests for assets. For larger files, it behaves like `file-loader` and emits the file.

### 2. Code Splitting

- [ ] What is code splitting in Webpack, and why is it important?
  - Code splitting is a technique in Webpack that allows you to split your code into multiple bundles. These bundles can be loaded on-demand or in parallel, which improves the performance of your web application by reducing the initial load time. Instead of delivering a single large JavaScript file, code splitting helps load only the necessary code for the current page or feature.
  - Importance of code splitting:
    - `Faster Initial Load Time:` By splitting the code into smaller chunks, you reduce the amount of JavaScript the browser needs to download, parse, and execute initially. This leads to faster page load times.
    - `On-Demand Loading:` Code splitting enables you to load code only when it's needed. For example, a user might not need to load a particular feature until they navigate to a specific section of the app.
    - `Efficient Caching:` If parts of your code rarely change, the browser can cache these chunks separately, so they don't need to be re-downloaded on subsequent visits.
    - `Improved Performance:` It helps in optimizing the performance of large-scale web applications, especially those with many features or pages.

- [ ] Explain the difference between dynamic imports and static imports in Webpack.
  - Static Imports:
    - Static imports use the import syntax at the top level of your code (e.g., `import './module.js'`;).
    - These imports are resolved at compile time, meaning that the code is included in the final bundle, regardless of whether or not it's used.
    - Static imports do not enable code splitting by themselves.
  - Dynamic Imports:
    - Dynamic imports use the `import()` function, which allows loading modules asynchronously at runtime.
    - This enables Webpack to create separate chunks for these modules and load them only when required.
    - It allows lazy loading and code splitting, meaning that the browser will only download the necessary code when it's actually needed, not at the initial load.

### 4. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

- [ ] What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and how does it improve development?
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in Webpack that allows you to replace, add, or remove modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload. This means that only the changed modules are updated in the browser, which results in faster feedback loops during development.
  - How HMR improves development:
    - `Faster Development:` Instead of reloading the entire page, only the changed code is updated. This makes updates nearly instant and reduces the need for full-page refreshes.
    - `State Preservation:` Since HMR only replaces the changed modules, the application state (such as form data or scroll position) is preserved, allowing for a smoother and more productive development experience.
    - `Improved Debugging:` Since the application doesn’t reload entirely, the developer can track the changes without losing any context, which improves the debugging process.
    - `Less Overhead:` Full-page reloads reset the entire application, including CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM. HMR minimizes this by applying changes directly to the page.

- [ ] What is the difference between live reloading and HMR?
    Both Live Reloading and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) aim to speed up development by updating the application in response to code changes, but they work differently:

  - Live Reloading:
    - Live Reloading automatically reloads the entire browser page whenever a file is modified.
    - The full application is refreshed (CSS, JavaScript, HTML, etc.).
    - It results in the application losing its current state (e.g., form inputs, scroll positions, etc.) because the entire page reloads.
    - Live Reloading is simpler to set up and works with many web development frameworks and bundlers.

  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
    - HMR only updates the changed modules, and it does not require a full page reload.
    - Only the specific module that has changed is replaced, and the rest of the application remains untouched.
    - The application state is preserved (e.g., data entered into forms, scroll positions, etc.).
    - HMR is more complex to set up and generally works best with JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) and tools that support module-level updates.

    | Feature                    | Live Reloading                      | Hot Module Replacement (HMR)         |
    |----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | **Page Reload**             | Full page reload                   | Only updates changed modules        |
    | **State Preservation**      | No state preservation               | Preserves application state         |
    | **Speed**                   | Slower (full reload)                | Faster (only changed parts replaced) |
    | **Setup Complexity**        | Easier to set up                    | More complex to set up              |
    | **Typical Use Case**        | Static sites, small apps            | Modern JavaScript apps (React, Vue) |
