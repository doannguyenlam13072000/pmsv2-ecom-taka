# VueJs

## Junior Level question

### 1. **Basics of Vue.js**

- [x] Explain the Virtual DOM in Vue.js.
  - When you update the state of a Vue component, Vue updates the Virtual DOM instead of manipulating the real DOM directly.
  - Vue then calculates the differences (or "diffs") between the old and the new Virtual DOM.
  - Finally, Vue applies these changes to the real DOM efficiently, minimizing performance overhead.

### 2. **Templates and Data Binding**

- [x] How does Vue.js handle two-way data binding?
  - `v-model`: Mechanism of Two-Way Data Binding
    - Binding Data to the View
    - Updating Data from the View
  - Process:
    - A `v-bind` to bind the value `(:value)`.
    - A `v-on` to listen for events `(@input, @change)`.

        ```html
            <input v-model="name" />
            
            <!-- Compiles to -->
            <input :value="name" @input="name = $event.target.value" />
        ```

- [x] What is the purpose of the `v-model` directive?
  - It keeps a DOM element's value and a component's data property in sync automatically.
  - Developers don’t need to manually bind values and handle events.

- [x] Explain the difference between v-bind and v-on.
  - `v-bind`: Binds attributes or props to dynamic values.
  - `v-on`: Attaches event listeners to DOM events.

### 3. **Directives**

- [x] What are Vue.js directives? Give examples of commonly used ones.
  - Directives are used to bind data, conditionally render elements, handle events, or perform other reactive tasks.
  - Commonly Used Directives: `v-bind, v-on, v-model, v-if, v-show, ...`

### 4. **Components**

- [x] How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?
  - Props

- [x] How can a child component communicate with a parent component?
  - $emit()
  - Provide/inject
  - Vuex/pinia
  - Event bus

## Middle Level question

### 1. **State Management**

- [x] How does Vue handle state management without Vuex?
  - Local state: `data() {return ...}`
  - Provide/Inject API
  - Reactive Stores (Composition API)
  - Third-Party Libraries (Pinia)

- [x] Explain the concept of getters, mutations, and actions in Vuex.
  - `Getters`
    - Compute derived state based on the store state.
    - Work like computed properties but for Vuex.
    - Cached until dependencies change.
  - `Mutations`
    - The only way to modify state in Vuex.
    - Must be synchronous.
    - Called by `committing` a mutation.
  - `Actions`
    - Used for asynchronous logic (e.g., API calls) before committing mutations.
    - Dispatched instead of committed.

### 2. **Lifecycle Hooks**

- [x] List the Vue.js lifecycle hooks and their use cases.
  - Lifecycle Hook Categories
    - Creation Phase: Initialization of the component.
    - Mounting Phase: DOM is created and inserted into the document.
    - Updating Phase: Component re-renders due to data or prop changes.
    - Destruction Phase: Component is destroyed and cleaned up.

  ### Lifecycle Hooks in Vue.js

  - `beforeCreate`: Executes before initializing data, props, or methods. Rarely used.
  - `created`: Executes after initializing reactive data, methods, and events, but before the DOM is available.
  - `beforeMount`: Executes before rendering the virtual DOM to the real DOM.
  - `mounted`: Executes after the DOM is mounted. Useful for accessing the DOM, making API calls, or setting up event listeners.
  - `beforeUpdate`: Executes before the component is re-rendered. Useful for accessing DOM before changes.
  - `updated`: Executes after the component has re-rendered. Useful for working with the updated DOM.
  - `beforeUnmount` (Vue 3) / `beforeDestroy` (Vue 2): Executes before a component is removed. Useful for cleanup, like removing event listeners or timers.
  - `unmounted` (Vue 3) / `destroyed` (Vue 2): Executes after a component is destroyed. Final cleanup step.

- [x] List the Vue.js lifecycle hooks and their use cases.
  - Lifecycle Hook Categories
    - Creation Phase: Initialization of the component.
    - Mounting Phase: DOM is created and inserted into the document.
    - Updating Phase: Component re-renders due to data or prop changes.

  ##### Lifecycle Hooks in Vue.js

  - `beforeCreate`: Executes before initializing data, props, or methods. Rarely used.
  - `created`: Executes after initializing reactive data, methods, and events, but before the DOM is available.
  - `beforeMount`: Executes before rendering the virtual DOM to the real DOM.
  - `mounted`: Executes after the DOM is mounted. Useful for accessing the DOM, making API calls, or setting up event listeners.
  - `beforeUpdate`: Executes before the component is re-rendered. Useful for accessing DOM before changes.
  - `updated`: Executes after the component has re-rendered. Useful for working with the updated DOM.
  - `beforeUnmount` (Vue 3) / `beforeDestroy` (Vue 2): Executes before a component is removed. Useful for cleanup, like removing event listeners or timers.
  - `unmounted` (Vue 3) / `destroyed` (Vue 2): Executes after a component is destroyed. Final cleanup step.

- [x] When would you use the beforeDestroy or unmounted hook?
  - The `beforeDestroy` (Vue 2) or `unmounted` (Vue 3) hook is used for cleanup tasks to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior when a component is removed.

- [x] What should be call api on `created` or `mounted` ?
  - When to Use created for API Calls:
    - When you don’t need access to the DOM
    - For API calls that don't need to manipulate the DOM
  - When to Use mounted for API Calls:
    - When you need access to the DOM
    - For API calls that depend on the DOM being available

### 3. **Routing**

- [x] Explain the difference between dynamic and static routing in Vue.
  - `Static Routing`: routes are defined ahead of time, usually in a single place (e.g., an array of route objects). These routes are fixed and cannot change based on user interaction or data.
  - `Dynamic Routing`: Dynamic routing involves defining routes dynamically at runtime. This allows for more flexible and conditional routing, where routes can be added or altered based on certain conditions or data.

- [x] What is Navigation Guard in Vue Router?
  - A Navigation Guard in Vue Router is a way to control the navigation flow in a Vue application. Navigation guards allow you to run specific logic or perform checks before, during, or after a route change.
  - Types of Navigation Guards:
    - Global Guards: These guards apply to all routes in the application.
      - `beforeEach`: Called before every route navigation.
      - `afterEach`: Called after every route navigation (cannot prevent navigation).
    - Route-specific Guards: These guards are defined inside individual route objects and are applied to that specific route.
      - `beforeEnter`: Runs before the navigation to that route.
    - Component Guards: These are lifecycle hooks inside the component itself, and they are more granular than the global guards. They can be used when a specific component is about to enter or leave.
      - `beforeRouteEnter`: Called before the route is confirmed and the component is created.
      - `beforeRouteUpdate`: Called when the route is updated (e.g., when the component is reused).
      - `beforeRouteLeave`: Called before the component leaves the route.

### 4. **Advanced Component Communication**

- [x] How can you use provide and inject in Vue.js?
  - `provide` and `inject` are used to share data between components without passing props explicitly.

- [x] What are scoped `slots`, and when should you use them?
  - A scoped slot is a type of slot in Vue.js that allows a child component to expose data or state to its parent component through a slot.
  - The parent component can then use the slot and bind the data passed by the child component to its own template.
  - Usage: Scoped slots are particularly useful when a child component wants to expose certain data or behaviors to its parent, allowing the parent to customize how to render that data.

- [x] Explain the `$refs` property in Vue.js.
  - The `$refs` property in Vue.js provides a way to access the DOM elements or child components directly in your Vue instance.

### 5. **Performance Optimization**

- [x] How can you optimize the performance of a Vue.js application?
  - Reduce Component Re-renders
    - Use `v-show` over `v-if` when elements toggle frequently: `v-show` only toggles visibility, while `v-if` adds/removes the DOM element, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders.
    - Use `computed` properties instead of methods: `Computed` properties are cached based on their dependencies, whereas `methods` are re-evaluated every time they are called.
    - Use `keep-alive` for components: This Vue built-in feature caches components and prevents them from being destroyed and recreated unnecessarily.
  - Optimize List Rendering:
    - Use `key` with `v-for`: The key attribute helps Vue identify which items have `changed`, `added`, or `removed`. It reduces `unnecessary` re-renders when lists update.
    - Avoid using the `index` as `key`: Using the item’s unique identifier as the key helps Vue identify changes in the list more efficiently.
  - Reduce JavaScript Bundle Size
    - `Lazy load components`: Split large components into smaller chunks that can be loaded only when required.
    - `Tree-shaking`: Use a bundler (like Webpack or Vite) with tree-shaking support to remove unused code from production builds.
  - Optimize Assets:
    - Lazy-load images and assets: Use the `loading="lazy"`
    - Use responsive images
    - Minimize third-party libraries

- [x] What is lazy loading?
  - `Lazy loading` is a performance optimization technique where content (usually JavaScript modules or images) is only loaded when it is needed (e.g., when the user scrolls to it or navigates to the corresponding page).

- [x] How does Vue.js use key to improve performance during rendering?
  - In Vue.js, the `key` attribute is crucial for optimizing the performance of list rendering. When you render lists of elements using `v-for`, Vue needs a way to identify which elements have changed, been added, or removed. The `key` helps Vue make these decisions efficiently.

- [x] Why Not Use Index as Key?
  - Using the array index (:key="index") as a key is not recommended because:
    - It leads to performance issues when the list is modified (items are added, removed, or re-ordered).
    - Vue would not be able to efficiently track changes because it would treat all elements as identical (since their keys would be the same across re-renders).

## Senior Level Questions

### 1. **Advanced Concepts**

- [x] Explain Vue's reactivity system. How does Vue track changes to data?
  - Vue.js uses a reactive data-binding system that automatically tracks changes to the application state and updates the view (DOM) accordingly. This system ensures that any changes in the data are reflected in the user interface in real-time. Vue achieves this reactivity using
  - How Vue Tracks Changes to Data:
    - Vue 2: Object.defineProperty:
      - In Vue 2, Vue uses Object.defineProperty to define getter and setter methods for each property in the data object.
      - Whenever a property is accessed or modified, Vue’s getter and setter methods are triggered. The getter collects dependencies (like components or watchers), and the setter triggers reactivity updates by notifying the watchers.
    - Vue 3: Proxy-based Reactivity:
      - In Vue 3, Vue replaces Object.defineProperty with Proxy. A Proxy is a JavaScript object that intercepts operations on the target object, such as reading properties and setting them.
      - The Proxy is more efficient and flexible than Object.defineProperty and can handle nested objects, arrays, and other reactive patterns more easily.
  - Reactivity Flow:
    - `Data Change`: A change in data triggers a setter, marking the property as "`dirty`."
    - `Dependency Tracking`: Vue tracks the components or functions that depend on the reactive data. These dependencies are registered during the data access.
    - `Re-render`: Vue triggers an update to the DOM when the dependent component needs to re-render.
  - `How Does Vue Handle Computed Properties?` Computed properties are also part of Vue's reactivity system. When a computed property is accessed, Vue tracks the dependencies of that property and re-evaluates it only when one of its dependencies changes.

## Additional Questions for Vue.js

- [x] What are the new features introduced in Vue 3?
  - Composition API
  - Performance Improvements
    - Faster Virtual DOM
    - Smaller Bundle Size
    - Better Reactivity
  - Teleport
  - Suspense
  - Fragment
  - v-model Improvements (multiple)
  - Emits Option
  - Better TypeScript Support
  - Hooks API (Lifecycle Hooks)

- [x] Explain the Composition API and how it improves code organization.
  - The Composition API is a new way to structure and organize logic in Vue components. It allows you to group related logic together, making your components more readable, reusable, and maintainable.

- [x] How do you use `reactive()` and `ref()` in Vue 3?
  - `reactive():` Used to make an object or array reactive. It tracks changes to properties and arrays and updates the DOM when changes occur.
  - `ref():` Used to create a reactive reference to a primitive value like a number, string, or boolean. Unlike reactive(), ref() works for primitive types.

- [x] How to virtual DOM work.
  - Virtual DOM Representation
    - The Virtual DOM is essentially a JavaScript object tree that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM.
    - Each node in the Virtual DOM is represented by a lightweight object with properties like `tag`, `props`, and `children`.

        ```javascript
            const vnode = {
                tag: 'div',
                props: { id: 'app' },
                children: [
                    {
                    tag: 'p',
                    props: {},
                    children: ['Hello']
                    }
                ]
        };
        ```

  - Template Compilation
    - Vue’s templates are compiled into `render functions` during the build process or at runtime.
    - These render functions return a Virtual DOM tree instead of manipulating the real DOM directly.

  - Updating the Virtual DOM
    - When data changes in Vue, the reactive system triggers the component to re-render.
    - The re-rendering process involves generating a new Virtual DOM tree based on the updated state.

  - Diffing Algorithm:
    - Vue compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using a diffing algorithm to identify changes.
    - The algorithm operates efficiently by:
      - Comparing nodes at the same level.
      - Assuming children with the same key are likely unchanged.
      - Only updating the parts of the DOM that actually changed.

  - Patching the Real DOM
    - Vue applies the changes (patches) identified during the diffing process to the real DOM.
    - It uses an efficient approach:
      - Add nodes: Insert only new nodes.
      - Remove nodes: Delete unnecessary nodes.
      - Update nodes: Modify only the changed attributes or text.

  - Static Node Optimization:
    - Vue optimizes the Virtual DOM by identifying static parts of the template during compilation.
    - Static nodes (unchanging parts) are skipped during diffing, improving performance.

- [x] How to know that nodes have not changed to skipp diffing
  - Static Node Detection
    - During the template compilation phase, Vue analyzes the template to identify static content (parts of the template that do not depend on reactive data).
    - Static nodes are marked and cached so that they do not participate in the diffing process.

        ```html
            <template>
                <div>
                    <h1>Static Title</h1> <!-- Static Node -->
                    <p>{{ message }}</p>  <!-- Dynamic Node -->
                </div>
            </template>
        ```

  - Keys in Nodes
    - Vue uses the key attribute to identify whether a node has changed or been reused.
    - Keys help Vue efficiently track which nodes are static by associating them with a unique identifier.

  - Patch Flags (Vue 3 Optimization):
    - Vue 3 introduces patch flags during template compilation.
    - These flags describe what parts of a node can change, so Vue can skip unnecessary checks.

        ```javascript
            // Example Virtual DOM representation with patch flags
            const vnode = {
                tag: 'div',
                props: { id: 'app' },
                children: [
                    { tag: 'p', props: {}, children: ['Static Text'], patchFlag: 0 }, // Static
                    { tag: 'span', props: { class: 'dynamic' }, children: ['Dynamic Text'], patchFlag: 1 } // Dynamic
                ]
            };
        ```

    - Vue inspects the patchFlag:
      - 0: Static node, skip.
      - 1: Dynamic node, diff only the specific part that can change.

    - Memoization of Static Nodes:
      - Vue caches the rendering of static nodes to avoid recreating them on each re-render.
      - If a node is determined to be static, Vue simply reuses the cached version.

    - Template-Specific Optimizations
      - Vue avoids re-evaluating expressions for static bindings

        ```html
        <div class="static-class">{{ dynamicContent }}</div>
        ```

      - Vue knows `class="static-class"` is constant and skips checking it on updates.
      - Only `{{ dynamicContent }}` is checked during re-renders.

- [x] Patch Flags (Vue 3 Optimization). Vue 3 introduces patch flags during template compilation. These flags describe what parts of a node can change, so Vue can skip unnecessary checks. How vue know 0 is static and 1 is dynamic.

  - Static Node Analysis
    - A node is considered static if:
      - It does not depend on reactive data (e.g., no variables or bindings are involved).
      - Its attributes and content are hardcoded in the template.
      - It does not include any dynamic directives like v-bind, v-if, or v-for.

  - Dynamic Node Analysis
    - A node is considered dynamic if:
      - It depends on reactive data (e.g., variables or computed properties).
      - It includes bindings (v-bind) or dynamic content ({{ ... }}).
      - It uses directives like v-if, v-for, or v-show.

  - How Vue Assigns Patch Flags
    - Vue uses a set of predefined binary flags to represent dynamic properties. These flags are assigned during compilation based on the node's structure.
    - Common Patch Flags:

        | Patch Flag | Value | Meaning                                                   |
        |------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | STATIC     | 0     | Node is static and can be skipped during updates.         |
        | TEXT       | 1     | Node has dynamic text content ({{ dynamicText }}).        |
        | CLASS      | 2     | Node has dynamic class bindings (:class).                 |
        | STYLE      | 4     | Node has dynamic style bindings (:style).                 |
        | PROPS      | 8     | Node has other dynamic properties (v-bind).               |
        | FULL       | 16    | Node has a fully dynamic structure (e.g., v-for, conditional rendering). |

  - Efficiency of Patch Flags
    - Patch flags allow Vue to:
      - Skip static nodes entirely during updates.
      - Focus updates only on specific parts of dynamic nodes (e.g., text, class, or style).
