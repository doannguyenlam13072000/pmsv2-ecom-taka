## MySQL Junior Level Interview Questions

### 1. MySQL Basics

- [x] What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR in MySQL?

    | Feature        | CHAR                                                                 | VARCHAR                                                                                     |
    |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Storage Type** | Fixed-length.                                                        | Variable-length.                                                                            |
    | **Storage Space** | Always uses the defined length (padded with spaces if shorter).    | Only uses the actual length of the data (plus 1 or 2 bytes for length storage).             |
    | **Performance** | Faster for fixed-size data.                                         | More efficient for varying-size data.                                                       |
    | **Use Case**     | Suitable for small, fixed-size fields (e.g., country codes).        | Suitable for fields with variable-length data (e.g., names).                               |

### 2. SQL Queries and Operations

- [x] Explain the different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN).
  - INNER JOIN
    - Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
    - If no match is found, the row is excluded.

        ```sql
        SELECT employees.name, departments.name
        FROM employees
        INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
        ```

    - Result: Only employees who belong to a department will be included.

  - LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
    - Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table.
    - If there is no match, NULL is returned for columns from the right table.

        ```sql
        SELECT employees.name, departments.name
        FROM employees
        LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
        ```

    - Result: All employees will be included, even those without a department.

  - RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
    - Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table.
    - If there is no match, NULL is returned for columns from the left table.

        ```sql
        SELECT employees.name, departments.name
        FROM employees
        RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
        ```

    - Result: All departments will be included, even if no employees belong to them.

- [x] What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE in MySQL?

    | **Criteria**      | **WHERE**                                                   | **HAVING**                                                 |
    |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Purpose**       | Filters rows before grouping data.                          | Filters groups or aggregate results after grouping data.  |
    | **Used With**     | Works with regular columns or expressions.                  | Works with aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG).   |
    | **Query Position**| Comes before GROUP BY.                                      | Comes after GROUP BY.                                      |

### 3. Data Types and Constraints

- [x] What is a UNIQUE constraint in MySQL?
  - A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column (or combination of columns) are distinct, meaning no two rows can have the same value in the specified column(s).
  - Key Points:
    - Allows NULL values (but only one NULL per column).
    - Used to enforce data integrity.

- [x] What is a FOREIGN KEY in MySQL?
  - A FOREIGN KEY is a constraint that establishes a relationship between two tables. It ensures that the value in a column (or group of columns) matches a value in the primary key column of another table.
  - Key Points:
    - Enforces referential integrity.
    - Helps maintain consistent and valid relationships between tables.
    - Can cascade actions like ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE.

- [x] What is the difference between PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints in MySQL?

    | **Criteria**         | **PRIMARY KEY**                                           | **UNIQUE Constraint**                                   |
    |-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Purpose**           | Uniquely identifies each record in a table.              | Ensures all values in a column (or combination) are unique. |
    | **Number per Table**  | Only one PRIMARY KEY per table.                          | Can have multiple UNIQUE constraints in a table.       |
    | **NULL Values**       | Does not allow NULL values.                              | Allows one NULL value per column.                      |
    | **Combination Columns** | Can combine multiple columns as a composite primary key. | Can also enforce uniqueness on a combination of columns. |
    | **Index Creation**    | Automatically creates a unique clustered index.          | Creates a non-clustered unique index.                 |

### 4. Indexes and Performance

- [x] What is an index in MySQL? How does it improve query performance?
  - An index is a data structure in MySQL used to quickly locate data in a table without scanning the entire table.
  - Key Points:
    - Works like an index in a book, helping MySQL find data faster.
    - Reduces query execution time for SELECT statements.
    - Can be created on one or more columns.

  - How It Improves Query Performance:
    - Speeds Up Lookups: Reduces the number of rows to examine.
    - Optimizes JOINs: Improves matching performance for JOIN conditions.
    - Improves Sorting: Speeds up ORDER BY and GROUP BY operations.

- [x] What is the difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a SECONDARY INDEX in MySQL?

    | **Criteria**         | **PRIMARY KEY**                                          | **SECONDARY INDEX**                                     |
    |-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Purpose**           | Uniquely identifies each row in a table.                | Used for quick lookups on non-primary key columns.      |
    | **Uniqueness**        | Always unique and cannot contain NULLs.                 | May or may not enforce uniqueness.                     |
    | **Number per Table**  | Only one PRIMARY KEY per table.                         | Can have multiple secondary indexes.                   |
    | **Index Type**        | Clustered index (data is stored with the key).          | Non-clustered index (points to the row location).       |
    | **Creation**          | Automatically created with a PRIMARY KEY declaration.   | Must be created explicitly using `CREATE INDEX`.        |

- [x] What is a `FULLTEXT` index, and how is it different from other indexes?
  - A `FULLTEXT` index is a special type of index designed for full-text searches in text columns. It enables fast searching for keywords in large text fields like `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, or `CHAR`.

    | **Aspect**           | **FULLTEXT Index**                                    | **Other Indexes (e.g., BTREE)**                     |
    |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | **Purpose**           | Optimized for keyword-based searches in text fields. | Optimized for exact matches or range-based searches. |
    | **Supported Queries** | Supports `MATCH ... AGAINST` syntax for natural language and Boolean searches. | Supports standard WHERE conditions.                |
    | **Use Case**          | Searching text-heavy fields like articles or comments. | Optimized for numeric, date, or smaller data fields. |
    | **Supported Storage** | Available only in `MyISAM` (historically) and `InnoDB` engines. | Supported by most storage engines.                 |

### 5. Normalization and Database Design

- [x] What is normalization in database design, and why is it important?
  - Normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to reduce redundancy(giảm dư thừa) and dependency. The goal is to ensure that the data is stored efficiently, without unnecessary duplication, and that the relationships between the data are logical and maintainable.
  - Why is it important?
    - Reduces Data Redundancy: Ensures that duplicate data is eliminated, saving storage space.
    - Improves Data Integrity: Reduces the chances of data anomalies like update, insert, and delete anomalies.
    - Enhances Query Efficiency: Structured data allows for faster query execution and more flexible relationships.
    - Simplifies Data Maintenance: Ensures consistency and makes it easier to update or delete data.

- [x] What are the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) in database normalization?
  - First Normal Form (1NF):
        A table is in 1NF if:
    - It only contains atomic (indivisible) values (no sets or arrays).
    - Each column contains values of a single type.
    - Each record is unique and identified by a primary key.
    - Example:
      - A column with multiple phone numbers would violate 1NF. It should be split into individual rows with one phone number per row.

  - Second Normal Form (2NF):
        A table is in 2NF if:
    - It is in 1NF.
    - It has no partial dependencies, meaning that non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key (for composite primary keys).
    - Example:
      - For a composite primary key of (student_id, course_id), a column student_name should not only depend on student_id but the whole key (student_id, course_id).

  - A table is in 3NF if:
    - It is in 2NF.
    - There is no transitive dependency, meaning that non-key attributes are not dependent on other non-key attributes.
    - Example:
      - If a table contains a column student_id and student_address, where student_address depends on student_id but also on student_name, then student_name must be removed, and student_address should be in a separate table.

- [x] Can you explain denormalization and why it might be used in some cases?
  - Denormalization is the process of deliberately (cố ý) introducing redundancy into a database by merging tables or adding redundant columns. This can be done for performance reasons, especially in read-heavy databases.
  - Why denormalization might be used:
    - Improved Query Performance: In highly normalized databases, many joins are required, which can be expensive in terms of performance. Denormalization can help by reducing the number of joins.
    - Faster Aggregations: By storing aggregated or summarized data, queries involving complex calculations can be sped up.
    - Reducing Join Complexity: Denormalization can simplify queries that would otherwise involve many tables or complex joins.

  - When to use denormalization:
    - In cases where read performance is critical and the data does not change frequently.
    - In reporting systems where quick access to precomputed results is needed.
    - When complex joins slow down query response time and the overhead of maintaining denormalized data is acceptable.

### 6. Transactions and ACID Properties

- [x] What is a transaction in MySQL?
  - A transaction in MySQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT) that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that a series of operations are completed successfully or, if an error occurs, rolled back to the previous consistent state.
  - Key Points:
    - Transactions help maintain the integrity of the database.
    - If any operation in a transaction fails, all changes made during that transaction can be undone (rollback).
    - Transactions are commonly used in financial systems, e-commerce applications, or any scenario requiring consistent data.

- [x] What are the ACID properties of a transaction? Explain each property (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  - Atomicity:
    - Definition: Atomicity ensures that all operations in a transaction are either fully completed or fully undone. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
    - Example: In a bank transfer transaction, if transferring money from one account to another fails midway, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no funds will be deducted or added.

  - Consistency:
    - Definition: Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another. The database must always meet the defined rules, constraints, and relationships before and after a transaction.
    - Example: If a transaction involves transferring money, consistency ensures that the sum of the balances in all accounts remains consistent before and after the transaction.

  - Isolation:
    - Definition: Isolation ensures that the operations of one transaction are isolated from the operations of other concurrent transactions. Even if multiple transactions are happening simultaneously, the results will be as if each transaction was executed sequentially.
    - Example: If two users attempt to withdraw money from the same account at the same time, isolation ensures that one transaction's changes are not visible to the other until the first transaction is completed.

  - Durability:
    - Definition: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the database crashes afterward. The results of the transaction are saved to the disk.
    - Example: If a transaction commits transferring funds from one account to another, the changes will be preserved, and the database will reflect those changes even after a power failure.

- [x] What is the purpose of the ROLLBACK statement in MySQL?
  - The ROLLBACK statement in MySQL is used to undo or "rollback" a transaction to its previous stable state in case of an error or failure. Any changes made during the transaction will be discarded, and the database will revert to the state it was in before the transaction began.
  - Key Points:
    - Used to cancel changes: If a transaction encounters an error or if the user decides not to proceed, ROLLBACK undoes all changes made by the transaction.
    - Ensures consistency: Helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that incomplete or incorrect data is not committed to the database.

### 7. Subqueries and Nested Queries

- [x] What is a subquery in MySQL, and how do you use it?
  - A subquery in MySQL is a query nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be used by the outer query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. They are often used when you need to perform an operation that depends on the result of another query.

- [x] Can you explain the difference between a correlated and a non-correlated subquery?
  - Non-correlated Subquery:
    - A non-correlated subquery is independent of the outer query. It can be executed on its own, without reference to the outer query.
    - It is typically used in WHERE, IN, EXISTS, or SELECT clauses.

        ```sql
        SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');
        ```

    - In this case, the subquery returns a single department_id that can be used directly by the outer query.

  - Correlated Subquery:
    - A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query. This means it cannot be executed idependently because it depends on the outer query for each row.
    - It is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.

        ```sql
        SELECT name FROM employees e
        WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
        ```

    - In this case, the subquery depends on the department_id of each employee being processed by the outer query.

### 8. Views and Stored Procedures

- [x] What is a view in MySQL, and how do you create one?
  - A view in MySQL is a virtual table that consists of a stored query. It allows you to simplify complex queries by abstracting them into reusable named queries, and it can be used as if it were a regular table.

- [x] What is a stored procedure in MySQL? How do you create one?
  - A stored procedure in MySQL is a set of SQL statements that can be stored and executed on the server. Stored procedures help in modularizing SQL code and improving performance by reducing network traffic.

    ```sql
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeInfo(IN dept_id INT)
    BEGIN
    SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = dept_id;
    END $$

    DELIMITER ;
    ```

- [x] What is the difference between a stored procedure and a function in MySQL?
  - Stored Procedure:
    - A stored procedure can perform operations such as querying and modifying data but does not necessarily return a value. It can have multiple operations and use input and output parameters.
    - It is called using CALL and does not return a value directly (although it can return result sets or update data).

  - Function:
    - A function is used to compute a value and always returns a single value (like INT, VARCHAR, etc.). Functions can be used in SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
    - It is called within a query like SELECT my_function(), and it must return a value.

### 9. MySQL Error Handling

- [x] What is the purpose of the EXPLAIN keyword in MySQL? How is it used to analyze a query?
  - The EXPLAIN keyword is used in MySQL to get information about how MySQL executes a query, including the tables it accesses, the order of joins, the indexes it uses, and the query execution plan. It helps to understand the efficiency of a query and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
