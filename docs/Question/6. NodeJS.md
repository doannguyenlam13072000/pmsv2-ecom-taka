# Node JS

## Junior Level Node.js Interview Questions

### 1. General Node.js Questions

- [x] How does Node.js handle concurrent(đồng thời) requests despite being single-threaded?
  - Node.js handles concurrency using asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations. While JavaScript itself is single-threaded, Node.js utilizes the event loop to manage multiple requests.
    - When a request comes in, Node.js delegates long-running tasks (like file system operations or database queries) to the thread pool or the kernel, allowing the main thread to continue processing other tasks.
    - Once the background operation is complete, Node.js uses a callback mechanism or Promises to notify the main thread, ensuring high performance and scalability.

- [x] What is the event loop in Node.js, and how does it work?
  - Incoming Requests: The main thread receives incoming requests and places them in the event loop.
  - Tasks Handling:
    - I/O Tasks (e.g., file reads, database queries) are sent to the thread pool or OS kernel.
    - Synchronous code runs on the main thread.
    - Phases of the Event Loop: The loop executes tasks in phases:
    - Timers: Executes setTimeout and setInterval callbacks.
    - Pending Callbacks: Handles I/O callbacks.
    - Idle, Prepare: Internal operations.
    - Poll: Retrieves new I/O events.
    - Check: Executes setImmediate callbacks.
    - Close Callbacks: Handles closed connections (e.g., socket.on('close')).
  - Once the event loop is idle(nhàn rỗi), it picks up tasks from the queue and processes them.

- [x] What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript running in the browser?

    |Aspect        | Node.js                        | JavaScript in Browser |
    |--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
    |Environment   | Runs on the server (V8 engine).   | Runs in the browser (V8 engine or others like SpiderMonkey).|
    |APIs        | Provides server-side APIs (e.g., file system, HTTP). | Provides DOM and browser APIs (e.g., `document`, `window`).|
    |Purpose    | Designed for backend development. | Designed for frontend, user interaction.|
    |Global Object | `global` is used.                   | `window` is used. |

- [x] What are the key advantages of using Node.js for backend development?
  - Non-Blocking I/O: Handles multiple requests efficiently using the event loop and asynchronous programming.
  - Single Programming Language: Developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, simplifying development.
  - Fast Performance: Built on Google’s V8 engine, Node.js executes JavaScript at high speed.
  - Large Ecosystem: NPM (Node Package Manager) provides access to a vast library of reusable modules.
  - Scalability: Ideal for building scalable, real-time applications like chat apps, online games, or streaming services.
  - Community Support: Strong developer community ensures continuous improvement and extensive resources.

### 2. Core Modules and NPM

- [x] What is NPM, and what is its role in Node.js development?
  - NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript and the default for Node.js. It serves two primary purposes:
    - `Package Installation:` Developers use NPM to install libraries or frameworks (e.g., Express, Lodash) into their projects.
    - `Package Management:` It allows developers to manage dependencies, including versions and updates.

- [x] What is the require() function in Node.js, and how does it work?
  - The require() function is used to import modules in Node.js. It allows you to include:
    - Core Modules: Built-in Node.js modules (e.g., fs, http).
    - Local Modules: Your own custom modules (e.g., ./myModule.js).
    - Third-Party Modules: Packages installed via NPM.
  - How It Works:
    - Locate the Module: Node.js looks for the module in the following order:
      - Core modules.
      - File paths (e.g., ./myModule.js).
      - node_modules directory.
    - Execute the Module: If the module exports a function or object, require() loads and executes it.
    - Cache the Module: Node.js caches the module to avoid reloading it in subsequent require() calls.

### 3. Asynchronous Programming

- [x] What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node.js?
  - Synchronous Code:
    - Executes sequentially, blocking the thread until the current task is complete.
    - Slower for tasks like I/O operations as it waits for each task to finish before moving to the next.

        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf-8'); // Blocks until the file is read
        console.log(data);
        console.log('This will run after the file is read.');
        ```

  - Asynchronous Code:
    - Non-blocking; the thread can handle other tasks while waiting for operations to complete.
    - Uses callbacks, Promises, or async/await for handling results.

        ```javascript
        const fs = require('fs');
        fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log(data); // Logs once the file is read
        });
        console.log('This runs while the file is being read.');
        ```

- [x] What is a Promise in Node.js? How does it improve handling asynchronous code?
  - A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It improves readability and avoids callback hell by chaining .then() and .catch().
  - States of a Promise:
    - `Pending`: The initial state.
    - `Fulfilled`: The operation completed successfully.
    - `Rejected`: The operation failed.

### 4. File System

- [x] What are the differences between fs.readFile() and fs.createReadStream() in Node.js?

    | Feature                  | `fs.readFile()`                                        | `fs.createReadStream()`                               |
    |--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    | **Type**                | Reads the entire file into memory before processing.  | Reads the file in chunks as a stream.              |
    | **Use Case**            | Suitable for small files.                             | Suitable for large files to avoid memory overhead. |
    | **Performance**         | May block the event loop for large files.             | Non-blocking and more efficient for large files.   |
    | **Memory Usage**        | Loads the entire file into memory.                    | Only loads small chunks into memory at a time.     |
    | **API Type**            | Callback/Promise-based.                               | Stream-based (EventEmitter).                      |

## Middle Level Node.js Interview Questions

### 1. Event Loop and Performance

- [x] How does the event loop work in Node.js, and what is its impact on performance?
  - Phases of the Event Loop:
    - Timers: Executes callbacks from setTimeout and setInterval.
    - Pending Callbacks: Executes I/O callbacks deferred by the OS.
    - Idle/Prepare: Internal use, prepares for polling.
    - Poll: Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O callbacks if available or waits for timers to expire.
    - Check: Executes setImmediate callbacks.
    - Close Callbacks: Executes close events like socket.on('close').

  - Impact on Performance:
    - Efficient handling of I/O: The event loop allows Node.js to process many concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
    - Bottlenecks: Long-running or CPU-intensive operations block the event loop, delaying other tasks.

| **API**                  | Built into Node.js runtime.                                                                       | Requires the `worker_threads` module.                                                            |
| **Example**              | Processing HTTP requests, database queries, file operations.                                      | Processing image resizing, data encryption, or complex computations.                             |

- [x] How does Node.js handle blocking operations, and how can you avoid blocking the event loop?
  - Node.js uses asynchronous programming to handle blocking operations efficiently. For I/O operations, Node.js delegates tasks to the underlying libuv library, which offloads these operations to a thread pool.
  - Avoiding Blocking the Event Loop:
    - Use Asynchronous APIs: Always prefer asynchronous methods (e.g., fs.readFile instead of fs.readFileSync).
    - Offload CPU-Intensive Tasks to Worker Threads: For tasks like encryption, compression, or data processing, use the worker_threads module.
    - Use Streaming for Large Files: Stream data instead of reading it all into memory at once.
    - Implement Queues or Throttling: Throttle heavy tasks or use libraries like Bull for task queues.
    - Avoid Synchronous APIs: Be cautious with methods like fs.readFileSync, crypto.pbkdf2Sync, or JSON.parse for large payloads.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- [x] What is JWT (JSON Web Token) ?
  - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is widely used for authentication and information exchange.
  - A JWT consists of three parts:
    - Header: Contains metadata, usually specifying the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).
    - Payload: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. Claims can be standard or custom.
    - Signature: Ensures the token’s integrity by signing the header and payload with a secret key.
