## Junior Level Questions

### Basics of Function Components

- [x] What is the difference between props and state in React?
  - Props:
    - Definition: Passed from parent to children
    - Purpose: Allow data passing from parent to childrend component
    - Scope: External to the component
    - Manage by: Parent component
  - State:
    - Definition: Managed within the component
    - Purpose: It holds dynamic data that determines how the component renders and behaves.
    - Managed By: The component itself

### State and Hooks

- [x] What is the `useState` hook, and how do you use it in a function component?
  - The `useState` hook in React is used to manage state in a functional component. It returns a state variable and a function to update that state

- [x] How do you use the `useEffect` hook in a function component? Can you explain its basic usage?
  - The `useEffect` hook in React allows you to perform side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation) in function components. It runs after the component renders and can also handle cleanup when the component unmounts or dependencies change.

- [x] What are dependencies in useEffect, and why are they important?
  - Dependencies in `useEffect` are variables or values that the effect depends on.
  - Why Dependencies Are Important:
    - Control Excution: Dependencies determine when the effect runs, avoiding unnecessary execution on every render.
    - Performance Optimization: By running the effect only when needed, you improve performance and avoid redundant side effects
    - Ensure Correct Behavior: Dependencies ensure the effect works with the most up-to-date values.

## Middle Level Questions

### Advanced State and Hooks

- [x] What is the useReducer hook, and when would you use it instead of useState?
  - The `useReducer` hook in React is used for managing more complex state logic in functional components, especially when the state depends on multiple sub-values or has complex update logic.
  - When to Use useReducer Instead of useState:
    - Complex State Logic: Use useReducer when state updates involve multiple sub-values or complex conditions.
    - Related State Transitions: When multiple state variables need to be updated together in a structured way.
    - Better Readability: For state management with many conditionals, useReducer organizes logic more cleanly than multiple useState calls.
    - Shared State Logic: When the same state logic needs to be reused in different parts of the component tree

- [x] How do you manage local component state with useState for complex forms or large data?
  - Use a Single State Object for Related Data
    - Group related fields into a single state object to avoid managing too many individual useState calls.
  - Modularize State Updates
    - Break large forms into sections or subcomponents. Each section can manage its own state to reduce the complexity of a single component.
  - Use Controlled Components
    - Ensure form inputs are "controlled components" where the `value` is tied to state and changes are explicitly handled via `onChange`
  - Manage Nested State with `useState`
    - For deeply nested state, consider using helper functions to update specific fields.
  - Optimize Performance
  - Validate State Dynamically
  - Consider useReducer for Very Complex State
  - External Libraries (Formik, React hook form, Yup)

- [x] What is the purpose of useContext, and how do you use it with function components?
  - The `useContext` hook in React allows you to access the value of a `Context` directly in a functional component without needing to use a `higher-order component` or render props. It simplifies the process of sharing state or data between components, especially in deeply nested component trees.
  - Purpose of useContext
    - `Simplifies State Sharing:` Share state, themes, authentication data, or configurations without passing props down multiple levels (prop drilling).
    - `Improves Readability:` Eliminates the need for intermediate components to act as props "passers."
    - `Centralized Data Management:` Useful for global or semi-global states like themes or user authentication.

- [x] What is different between useReducer useContext zustand
  - `useReducer`
    - A React hook for managing local, complex state logic within a component.
    - Works like a Redux reducer: you define a reducer function and dispatch actions to update the state.
  - `useContext`
    - A React hook for accessing a context value provided by a parent component.
    - Typically used to share state or functions globally without prop drilling.
  - `Zustand`
    - A lightweight, scalable state management library for React.
    - Provides a centralized store for managing state across the application without the boilerplate of Redux or the limitations of React Context.
- [x] How do you perform asynchronous actions in a function component, such as API calls? Can you use `useEffect` for this?
  - Yes, you can use `useEffect` to perform asynchronous actions like API calls in a functional component. However, since `useEffect` itself cannot directly return a promise (which would break the effect), you need to handle the asynchronous logic inside the `useEffect` using a helper function or an async `IIFE` (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

- [x] How do you use useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance in function components?
  - `useMemo`: Use for expensive computations or derived data that you want to avoid recalculating on every render.
  - `useCallback`: Use when passing functions to child components or hooks to avoid creating new instances on each render.

### Component Lifecycle

- [x] What is the useLayoutEffect hook, and when should it be used instead of useEffect?
  - `useLayoutEffect` is a hook in React that functions similarly to `useEffect`, but it is executed synchronously after all DOM mutations (i.e., after the render phase but before the browser paints). This makes it useful for operations that need to be done before the layout is painted, such as reading and modifying DOM elements for layout calculations.
  - Difference Between useEffect and useLayoutEffect
    - `useEffect`:
      - Runs asynchronously after the render and paint (i.e., after the DOM is painted on the screen).
      - Suitable for side effects that do not affect layout or need to interact with the DOM directly (e.g., fetching data, setting up subscriptions, timers).
    - `useLayoutEffect`:
      - Runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before the browser paints.
      - Useful for side effects that need to read and modify the DOM before the layout and paint phase (e.g., measuring elements, setting up animations, or manipulating styles).

### Prop-Drilling and Context API

- [x] What is prop-drilling, and how can you avoid it in a React app?
  - `Prop-drilling` refers to the process where you pass data through multiple layers of components, even if some of those intermediate components do not need the data. This can lead to a cumbersome and difficult-to-maintain component hierarchy, especially when dealing with deeply nested components.
  - `How to Avoid Prop-Drilling:` Using Context API, Using State Management Libraries, Component Composition (Using Render Props or Higher-Order Components), Use of Local State for Independent Components

- [x] Can you explain the difference between useContext and prop-drilling?
  - `Prop-Drilling:`
    - Prop-drilling refers to the process where you pass data from a parent component to its deeply nested child components, even if some of those intermediate components don’t need the data.
  - `useContext`:
    - `useContext` is a React hook that allows you to access values from the context directly without needing to pass them as props down through each intermediate component.

### Performance Optimization

- [x] How can you optimize the performance of a function component in React?
  - `Memoization`: Use memoization techniques like useMemo and React.memo to prevent unnecessary recalculations or re-renders.
  - `Avoiding Inline Functions:` Inline functions (such as those created inside render methods) cause re-renders every time the component re-renders. Define functions outside the render logic or use useCallback to memoize them.
  - `Lazy Loading:` Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed, reducing the initial loading time.
  - `Code Splitting:` Split your code into smaller chunks using tools like Webpack or React.lazy.
  - `Virtualization:` For large lists or tables, use windowing or virtualization libraries like react-window to only render the items that are in view.
  - `Avoid Unnecessary State Updates:` Ensure that state updates are necessary before triggering re-renders (e.g., use useState carefully to avoid unnecessary updates).
  - `Pure Components:` Use React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders for components with the same props.

- [x] What are the benefits of useMemo and useCallback hooks in preventing unnecessary re-renders?
  - `useMemo`:
    - `Purpose`: useMemo is used to memoize the result of an expensive calculation. It ensures that the calculation is only recomputed when the dependencies change, avoiding recalculations on every render.
    - `When to Use`: Use useMemo when you need to memoize a computed value that is expensive to compute.
  - `useCallback`:
    - `Purpose`: useCallback is used to memoize functions so that they do not get redefined on every render unless their dependencies change.
    - `When to Use`: Use useCallback when you need to pass a function down as a prop to child components, and you want to prevent the child from unnecessarily re-rendering due to the function being recreated.

- [x] What is the React.memo function, and how does it work with function components?
  - `React.memo`:
    - `Purpose`: React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a function component, preventing it from re-rendering if the props haven’t changed.
    - `When to Use`: Use React.memo when you have functional components that receive props and you want to optimize re-renders by avoiding unnecessary renders when the props remain the same.

## Senior Level Questions

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- [x] What is code splitting in React, and how can you implement it using React.lazy and Suspense in function components?
  - Code Splitting is a technique used to split your application into smaller, more manageable chunks, so that only the necessary code is loaded at the start, reducing the initial load time of the application. React provides built-in support for code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.

  - Implementing Code Splitting with React.lazy and Suspense:
    - React.lazy: This function allows you to dynamically import a component only when it's needed, rather than loading all components upfront.
    - Suspense: This component is used to wrap components that are being lazily loaded. It can show a fallback UI (like a loading spinner) while the component is being loaded asynchronously.

    ```javascript
        import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

        // Lazily load the component
        const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

        function App() {
        return (
            <div>
            <h1>Code Splitting Example</h1>
            {/* Suspense is used to show a loading indicator until the lazy-loaded component is ready */}
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <MyComponent />
            </Suspense>
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default App;
    ```

- [x] How does React handle lazy loading for components, and when should you use it?
  - Dynamic Import: React uses dynamic imports (via import())
  - React.lazy: When a component is wrapped with React.lazy
  - Suspense: It is used to display fallback content while waiting for the component to load, ensuring the UI remains responsive.

- [x] How do you optimize lazy-loaded components for performance and user experience?
  - Use Suspense with Fallback UI
  - Split Code Based on Routes (React Router)
  - Preload Critical Resources
  - Avoid Too Many Lazy Loaded Components
  - Optimize Bundle Size with Webpack
  - Handle Error Boundaries

### High-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props

- [x] What are higher-order components (HOCs), and how do they work in function components?
  - A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality or behavior. HOCs don't modify the original component but wrap it to add props, state, or side effects.

  - How HOCs work:
    - An HOC receives a component as an argument.
    - It wraps that component and returns a new component.
    - It can add extra props, logic, or lifecycle methods.

    ```javascript
        import React from 'react';

        // HOC that adds additional behavior (e.g., logging)
        function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
            return function(props) {
                console.log("Component rendered with props:", props);
                return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
            };
        }

        function MyComponent({ message }) {
            return <div>{message}</div>;
        }

        // Enhanced component with added logging functionality
        const MyComponentWithLogging = withLogging(MyComponent);

        export default function App() {
            return <MyComponentWithLogging message="Hello, world!" />;
        }
    ```

- [x] Can you explain the difference between HOCs and hooks in React?
  - HOCs
    - Purpose: Used to add reusable logic and behavior to components.
    - Usage: Wraps a component and returns a new component.
    - Reusability: Reuse functionality by wrapping multiple components with an HOC.
    - Functionality: Can add functionality such as logging, authentication, etc., but modifies the component tree.

  - Hooks
    - Purpose: Used to manage state, side effects, and other logic directly in functional components.
    - Usage: Used directly in functional components to manage local state and lifecycle methods.
    - Reusability: Reuse functionality by creating custom hooks that can be called in any functional component.
    - Functionality: Can handle side effects, state, and other logic without modifying the component structure.

### New Topics

- [x] What is the role of "keys" in lists in React, and why are they important for performance?
  - In React, `keys` are used to uniquely identify elements in a list or collection. They help React efficiently determine which items have changed, been added, or removed, optimizing the process of updating the DOM.
  - Why are keys important:
    - Performance: Without keys, React needs to re-render all list items. With keys, React can efficiently update only the changed items.
    - Correctness: Keys help React track the identity of elements in a list across re-renders.

- [x] How do you handle state persistence across reloads in React?
  - To persist state across page reloads, you can use localStorage or sessionStorage, which store data in the browser.

- [x] What is Virtual DOM in reactjs ?
  - The Virtual DOM (VDOM) in React is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). React uses it to optimize updates and rendering in the UI.
  - How It Works:
    - Virtual Representation:
      - React creates an in-memory representation of the DOM tree (Virtual DOM).
      - This is a copy of the actual DOM but exists only in memory.

    - State or Prop Changes:
      - When state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM instead of the real DOM immediately.

    - Diffing Algorithm:
      - React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the changes (called "diffing").

    - Reconciliation:
      - React calculates the minimum set of updates needed and applies them to the real DOM efficiently.

- [x] Explain Virtual DOM work ?
  - The Process of Virtual DOM Operations
    - Step 1: Rendering the Initial Virtual DOM
      - When a React application starts, it creates a Virtual DOM tree that represents the structure of the UI.
      - React renders this Virtual DOM based on the initial state and props of components.
    - Step 2: Triggering a Change
      - Changes in the application (e.g., a user interaction, API response) update the state or props of components.
    - Step 3: Updating the Virtual DOM
      - React re-renders the component with the updated state or props.
            This creates a new Virtual DOM tree to represent the updated UI.
    - Step 4: Diffing
      - React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous Virtual DOM tree using a process called the Diffing Algorithm.
      - The algorithm identifies the differences (known as patches) between the two trees.
    - Step 5: Reconciliation
      - React determines the minimal number of changes required to update the real DOM.
      - React applies these changes (patches) to the real DOM efficiently.
  - Diffing Algorithm
    - The diffing algorithm is a crucial (chủ yếu) part of how the Virtual DOM works. It determines what changes have occurred between two Virtual DOM trees. Here's how it works:
    - Key Steps in Diffing:
      - Element Type Comparison:
        - If two elements are of the same type (e.g., `<div>`), React checks their attributes and updates only those that changed.
        - If the element types differ, React replaces the old element with the new one in the DOM.
      - Keyed Lists:
        - For lists of elements (e.g., `<ul>` with `<li>`), React uses keys to efficiently match and reorder elements.
      - Child Nodes:
        - React recursively applies the diffing algorithm to child elements.

            ```html
            <!-- Old Virtual DOME -->
            <div>
                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p>World</p>
            </div>

            <!-- New virtual DOM -->
            <div>
                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p>React</p>
            </div>

            ```

  - Reconciliation
    - After diffing, React reconciles the differences by updating the real DOM selectively, without re-rendering the entire UI.
    - Example:
      - Instead of re-rendering the entire `<div>`, React modifies only the `<p>` tag in the real DOM.

- [x] Explain Diffing Algorithm work ?
  - Key Principles of the Diffing Algorithm
    - Minimizing Computational Complexity:
      - The naive way to compare two trees is an 𝑂(𝑛^3) operation (comparing every node in one tree with every node in the other).
      - React's diffing algorithm optimizes this to O(n) by using assumptions about how the DOM is structured and how elements change.

    - Heuristics Used by React:
      - Different element types result in a replacement: If two nodes are of different types (e.g., <`div>` vs. `<span>`), React removes the old node and creates a new one.
      - Reordering is avoided unless necessary: React assumes that elements of the same type with the same keys remain in the same order.

  - How the Diffing Algorithm Works
    - Step 1: Comparing Elements
      - If two elements are of different types, React destroys the old DOM node and creates a new one from scratch.
      - If two elements are of the same type:
        - React updates only the changed attributes (e.g., className, style).
        - React recursively compares the children of these elements.
      - Example:
        - Old Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <div className="box">
                    <p>Hello</p>
                </div>
            ```

        - New Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <div className="container">
                    <p>Hello</p>
                </div>
            ```

      - Diff Result:
        - The `<div>`'s `className` is updated from box to container.
        - The `<p>` remains unchanged.

    - Step 2: Handling Children
      - Unkeyed Lists: React compares child nodes one by one, assuming they remain in the same order.
      - Keyed Lists: React uses keys to identify which children have changed, been added, or been removed.
      - Example (Keyless List):
        - Old Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple</li>
                    <li>Banana</li>
                </ul>
            ```

        - New Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <ul>
                    <li>Banana</li>
                    <li>Cherry</li>
                </ul>
            ```

      - Diff Result:
        - React assumes the first `<li>` changed from Apple to Banana and the second changed from Banana to Cherry.

      - Example (Keyed List):
        - Old Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <ul>
                    <li key="1">Apple</li>
                    <li key="2">Banana</li>
                </ul>
            ```

        - New Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <ul>
                    <li key="2">Banana</li>
                    <li key="3">Cherry</li>
                </ul>
            ```

      - Diff Result:
        - React recognizes that the `<li>` with `key="1"` is removed and a new `<li>` with `key="3"` is added.

    - Step 3: Updating the DOM
            Once React identifies the differences:
      - It generates a patch for the real DOM.
      - Only the changed parts are updated, ensuring efficient rendering.

    - Optimizations in the Diffing Algorithm
      - Keyed Elements:
        - By assigning unique key props to elements in a list, React efficiently tracks changes like additions, deletions, or reordering.

      - Component Updates:
        - If a component's type remains the same, React skips re-rendering its subtree and updates only its props/state.

      - Skipping Unnecessary Work:
        - React skips comparisons for components wrapped in React.memo or when shouldComponentUpdate returns false.

      - Examples
        - Text Content Change
          - Old Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <div>Hello</div>
            ```

          - New Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <div>Hi</div>
            ```

          - Diff Result:
            - React updates only the text content of the `<div>`

        - Element Type Change
          - Old Virtual DOM:

            ```html
            <div>Hello</div>
            ```

          - New Virtual DOM:

            ```html
                <span>Hello</span>
            ```

          - Diff Result:
            - React removes the `<div>`and replaces it with a new `<span>`.
    - Importance of Keys in Lists
        Keys help React identify which elements:
      - Stay the same.
      - Change content.
      - Are removed or added.

        `Without Keys:`
            - React assumes changes are positional and may perform unnecessary updates.

        `With Keys:`
            - React efficiently reorders elements and minimizes updates.
