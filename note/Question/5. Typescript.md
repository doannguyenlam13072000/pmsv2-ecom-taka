# Typescript

## Junior Level Questions

1. TypeScript Basics
- [ ] What is TypeScript, and how does it differ from JavaScript?
    - TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles down to plain JavaScript. It adds features like static typing, interfaces, and generics.
    - While JavaScript is dynamically typed and executed directly by browsers, TypeScript requires compilation to JavaScript before running.

- [ ] Why would you choose TypeScript over JavaScript?
    - Static Typing: Helps catch errors during development instead of at runtime.
    - Better Tooling: Improved autocompletion, type checking, and debugging support in IDEs.
    - Maintainability: Clearer code structure and easier refactoring.
    - Scalability: Suitable for large codebases where strict typing helps manage complexity.

- [ ] What is the role of the TypeScript compiler?
    - The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts TypeScript code into plain JavaScript that can run in any JavaScript environment. During compilation, it also performs type checking to catch errors and ensure the code adheres to the specified types.

2. Basic Types
- [ ] What is the difference between any, unknown, void, and never?
    - `any`:
        - Can hold any type of value, bypassing type checking.
        - Use cautiously (thận trọng) as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript.
    - `unknown`:
        - Similar to any, but requires type checks before use.
        ```typescript
            let value: unknown = "hello";
            if (typeof value === "string") {
            console.log(value.toUpperCase());
            }
        ```
    - `never`:
        - Represents functions or expressions that never return, such as errors or infinite loops.
        ```typescript
            function throwError(message: string): never {
                throw new Error(message);
            }
        ```

3. Interfaces and Types
- [ ] What is an interface in TypeScript, and how do you use it?
    - An interface in TypeScript defines the structure of an object by specifying its properties and their types. Interfaces provide a way to enforce type safety and describe the expected shape of an object.
    - Interfaces can also extend other interfaces to create more complex types:
    ```typescript
    interface User {
        id: number;
        name: string;
        isActive: boolean;
    }

    interface Address {
        city: string;
        country: string;
    }

    interface UserWithAddress extends User, Address {}

    const userWithAddress: UserWithAddress = {
        id: 2,
        name: "Alice",
        isActive: false,
        city: "New York",
        country: "USA",
    };
    ```

- [x] What is the difference between an interface and a type alias?
    | Feature            |**Interface**                                         | **Type Alias**                             |
    |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | **Definition**     | Defines the structure of an object.                  | Can define objects, unions, intersections, primitives, or any other type.                    |
    | **Extensibility**  | Supports `extends` to inherit from other interfaces. | Supports intersections (`&`) to combine types but does not use `extends`.                    |
    | **Merging**        | Can be merged across multiple declarations.          | Cannot be merged. Each `type` declaration is unique.                                         |
    | **Complex Types**  | Limited to defining object shapes.                   | More versatile; can define unions, intersections, or even functions and primitives.          |
    | **Example**        | ```typescript interface User { id: number; } ```     | ```typescript type User = { id: number; } ``` |
    - When to Use:
        - Use interfaces for defining object shapes, especially when you need inheritance or declaration merging.
        - Use type aliases for more flexible or complex types like unions, intersections, or primitives.
        
4. Functions
- [x] What is the difference between void and never in a function return type?
    - `void`:
        - Represents a function that does not return a value or explicitly returns undefined.
        - Commonly used for functions like event handlers or logging functions.
    - `never`:
        - Represents a function that never completes, either because it throws an error or runs indefinitely.
        - Used for unreachable code or functions that don't have a valid return point.
        ```typescript
        function throwError(message: string): never {
            throw new Error(message);
        }

        ```

5. Arrays and Tuples

- [x] What is a tuple in TypeScript? Provide an example.
    - A tuple in TypeScript is a fixed-length array where each element has a specific type and order. It allows storing multiple types in a single array.
    ```typescript
        let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
        console.log(person[0]); // "Alice"
        console.log(person[1]); // 30
    ```

- [x] How do you ensure a tuple contains specific types in a specific order?
    - To ensure specific types and order in a tuple, you define it with the desired types in the exact sequence.
    - Example:
    ```typescript
        let data: [string, number, boolean] = ["John", 25, true];

        // Incorrect order or types will cause an error:
        let invalidData: [string, number, boolean] = [25, "John", true]; // Error
    ```
    Adding restrictions using readonly:
    - If you want to make the tuple immutable, use the readonly keyword:

    ```typescript
        let coordinates: readonly [number, number] = [10, 20];
        // coordinates[0] = 15; // Error: Cannot assign to a readonly property
    ```
    - This ensures that the tuple has specific types, a specific order, and cannot be modified.

7. Compilation and Configuration
- [x] What is the purpose of the tsconfig.json file?
    - The tsconfig.json file is a configuration file used to specify the compiler options and the files to be included/excluded during the TypeScript compilation process. It allows you to configure TypeScript settings and provide the compiler with the necessary information about your project.

    - Common properties in tsconfig.json:
        - `compilerOptions`: Contains TypeScript compiler options, such as module system, target JavaScript version, strictness settings, etc.
        - `include`: Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation.
        - `exclude`: Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation.

## Middle Level Questions
1. Advanced Types
- [x] What are union and intersection types? Provide examples.
    - `Union Types`:
        - A union type allows a variable to hold one of several types. You define a union type by separating the types with the pipe (|) symbol.

        - Example (Union Type):
        ```typescript
        let value: string | number;
        value = "Hello";  // valid
        value = 42;       // valid
        value = true;     // error: type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'
        ```
    
    - `Intersection Types`:
        - An intersection type combines multiple types into one. A variable of an intersection type will have all the properties and behaviors of the combined types. You define an intersection type by using the ampersand (&) symbol.
        - Example (Intersection Type):
        ```typescript
        type A = { name: string };
        type B = { age: number };
        type C = A & B;

        let person: C = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
        ```

- [x] How do you use type guards in TypeScript?
    - A type guard is a technique used to narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block, allowing TypeScript to infer the type more accurately. TypeScript has several ways to create type guards, including typeof, instanceof, and user-defined type guards.
    - Using typeof for Primitive Types:
        ```typescript
        function example(value: string | number) {
            if (typeof value === "string") {
                console.log(value.toUpperCase());  // `value` is treated as a string here
            } else {
                console.log(value.toFixed(2));     // `value` is treated as a number here
            }
        }
        ```
    - Using instanceof for Classes:
        ```typescript
            class Dog {
                bark() {
                    console.log("Woof");
                }
            }

            class Cat {
                meow() {
                    console.log("Meow");
                }
            }

            function makeSound(animal: Dog | Cat) {
                if (animal instanceof Dog) {
                    animal.bark();  // animal is treated as a Dog here
                } else {
                    animal.meow();  // animal is treated as a Cat here
                }
            }
        ```

- [x] What is the difference between readonly and const in TypeScript?
    - `readonly`:
        - The readonly modifier is used to define properties of an object or array that cannot be reassigned after their initialization. It makes the property immutable(bất biến) but does not prevent the object or array itself from being reassigned.
        ```typescript
        interface Person {
            readonly name: string;
            age: number;
        }

        const person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
        person.age = 26;          // Valid: age is not readonly
        person.name = "Bob";      // Error: name is readonly
        ```
    - `const`:
        - The `const` keyword is used to define variables that cannot be reassigned. However, it does not affect the contents of objects or arrays—only the reference to the variable itself is immutable.
2. Generics
- [x] What are generics in TypeScript, and why are they useful?
    - Generics in TypeScript allow you to write functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with any data type while preserving the type information. They provide flexibility by enabling you to create reusable components that can handle different types while maintaining type safety. Generics make your code more flexible and reusable, allowing for strong typing across different use cases.

- [x] What are constraints(hạn chế) in generics? - How do you use them?
    - Constraints in generics allow you to restrict the types that can be used with a generic. You can specify that a type parameter must extend a particular type or interface, ensuring that the generic type behaves in a certain way.

    - You use constraints with the `extends` keyword. This ensures that the type parameter must be a subtype of the specified type or interface.
    ```typescript
    interface Lengthwise {
        length: number;
    }

    function logLength<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): void {
        console.log(arg.length);
    }

    logLength("Hello, world!"); // Works: string has a 'length' property
    logLength([1, 2, 3]);       // Works: array has a 'length' property
    logLength(42);              // Error: number does not have a 'length' property
    ```
    
3. Type Assertions
- [x] What is a type assertion, and how do you use it?
    - A type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler to treat a value as a specific type, even if TypeScript cannot infer the type on its own. Type assertions do not perform any runtime checks or changes; they are purely a compile-time feature that provides additional type information to the compiler.

    - You can use type assertions when you are confident that the value will conform to a certain type, but TypeScript is unable to infer it.
    ```typescript
    let someValue: any = "Hello, World!";
    let stringLength: number = (someValue as string).length;  // Assert that 'someValue' is a string
    ```

- [x] What is the difference between as syntax and angle-bracket syntax for type assertions.
    - There are two syntaxes in TypeScript to perform type assertions: as syntax and angle-bracket syntax. Both achieve the same result, but the choice depends on personal preference or code style.

        - `as syntax`: This syntax is more commonly used in modern TypeScript and works consistently with both JSX and non-JSX code.
            ```typescript
            let someValue: any = "Hello, World!";
            let stringLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
            ```
        - `Angle-bracket syntax:` This syntax uses angle brackets `(< >)` to assert a type. It is not recommended when working with JSX (in React) because it conflicts with JSX tags.
            ```typescript
            let someValue: any = "Hello, World!";
            let stringLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
            ```
- [x]  When should you avoid using type assertions?
    - When you're unsure of the type
    - When it bypasses the type system
    - When working with dynamic data
    
4. Modules
- [x] What is the difference between import and require?
    - `Static vs. Dynamic Loading`: import is statically resolved at compile-time, while require is resolved at runtime.
    - `ES Modules vs. CommonJS`: import uses ES6 module syntax, whereas require uses CommonJS.
    - `Tree-shaking`: import allows bundlers to remove unused code (tree-shaking), while require does not.

5. Type Compatibility
- [ ] How does TypeScript determine if two types are compatible?
    - TypeScript uses structural typing to determine if two types are compatible. It compares the shape of the types, meaning that TypeScript checks if the types have the same properties and methods, and their corresponding types match.
    - In structural typing, TypeScript doesn't care about the names of the types or their declarations. Instead, it focuses on whether the types have compatible structures (i.e., the same properties with the correct types).
    ```typescript
    interface Animal {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    interface Dog {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    let animal: Animal = { name: 'Buddy', age: 5 };
    let dog: Dog = { name: 'Rex', age: 4 };

    animal = dog;  // This works because the shapes of 'Animal' and 'Dog' are compatible
    ```

- [ ] What is structural typing in TypeScript?
    - Structural typing means that TypeScript determines type compatibility based on the structure (properties and methods) of types, rather than their names or origin.
    - This is different from nominal typing, where two types are considered compatible only if they are explicitly declared as the same type, regardless of their structure.
    - In TypeScript:
        - If two types have the same shape (i.e., they have the same members with the same types), they are compatible.
        - It doesn't matter if the types have different names or come from different sources.
    ```typescript
    interface Point {
        x: number;
        y: number;
    }

    let point: Point = { x: 5, y: 10 };

    let anotherPoint = { x: 5, y: 10 };  // This is compatible with 'Point' because it has the same structure

    point = anotherPoint;  // This works because 'anotherPoint' has the same shape as 'Point'
    ```

6. Utility Types
- [ ] What are utility types in TypeScript?
    - Utility types in TypeScript are pre-defined generic types that allow you to transform or manipulate other types in useful ways. These types can be used to create new types based on existing ones, enabling flexibility and reusability in your code.

    - Common utility types include:
        - `Partial`
        - `Required`
        - `Pick`
        - `Omit`
        - `Record`
        - `Exclude`
        - `Extract`
        - `Readonly`
    - Utility types help simplify type transformations and reduce the amount of custom type logic you need to write.

- [ ] Explain the use of Partial, Required, and Pick.
    - `Partial<T>`
        - `Partial` makes all properties of a given type T optional. It is useful when you want to create a type that represents a subset of the original type where none of the properties are required.
        ```typescript
        interface User {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            email: string;
        }

        const user: Partial<User> = {
            name: 'John'  // Only 'name' is required, 'age' and 'email' are optional
        };
        ```
    - `Required<T>`
        - `Required` makes all properties of a given type T required. It is the opposite of Partial, ensuring that every property must be present.
        ```typescript
        interface User {
            name?: string;
            age?: number;
            email?: string;
        }

        const user: Required<User> = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            email: 'john@example.com'  // All properties must be provided, even if they were optional in the original type
        };
        ```
    - `Pick<T, K>`
        - `Pick` allows you to create a new type by selecting a subset of properties K from type T. It is useful when you need to extract only specific properties from a larger type.
        ```typescript
        interface User {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            email: string;
        }

        const user: Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'> = {
            name: 'John',
            email: 'john@example.com'  // Only 'name' and 'email' are included, 'age' is omitted
        };
        ```

- [ ] What is the difference between Record and Mapped types?
    - `Record<K, T>`
        - Record is a utility type that constructs an object type with keys of type K and values of type T. It is useful when you want to create an object where the keys are of a certain type and the values are of another type.
        ```typescript
        type User = 'Alice' | 'Bob' | 'Charlie';
        type UserScores = Record<User, number>;

        const scores: UserScores = {
            Alice: 90,
            Bob: 85,
            Charlie: 88
        };
        ```
    - `Mapped Types`
        - Mapped types allow you to create new types by transforming the properties of an existing type. Mapped types are more flexible than Record, as they can apply transformations or conditions to the properties of the base type.
        ```typescript
            { [P in K]: T }
            type User = { name: string; age: number; email: string };
            type ReadOnlyUser = { readonly [K in keyof User]: User[K] };

            const user: ReadOnlyUser = {
                name: 'John',
                age: 30,
                email: 'john@example.com'
            };

            user.name = 'Jane';  // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
            // In this example, ReadOnlyUser is a mapped type that makes all properties of User read-only by using the readonly modifier.
        ```

7. Decorators
- [x] What is a decorator in TypeScript?
    - A decorator in TypeScript is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. It is a function that is called at runtime to modify the behavior of the element it is attached to.
    - Decorators provide a way to modify or extend the functionality of the target, whether it's a class, method, or property, without directly modifying the source code.

- [x] What are the different types of decorators available in TypeScript?
    - `Class Decorators:` Applied to a class constructor. They are used to modify or extend the behavior of a class.
    - `Method Decorators:` Applied to methods of a class. They are used to modify the behavior of a method.
    - `Accessor Decorators:` Applied to getter or setter methods. They modify the behavior of a property getter or setter.
    - `Property Decorators:` Applied to properties within a class. These are used to modify the property behavior or add metadata.
    - `Parameter Decorators:` Applied to method parameters. They are useful for adding metadata or altering method parameter behavior.

8. Error Handling
- [ ] How does TypeScript improve error detection during development?
- [ ] What is the purpose of the strict mode in TypeScript?
    - Strict mode in TypeScript is a set of compiler options that enables stricter type-checking rules to enhance the safety of your code. When strict mode is enabled, TypeScript performs additional checks to catch potential errors and enforce better coding practices.
    - Some of the important checks enabled by strict mode include:
        - `strictNullChecks`: Ensures that null and undefined are treated as distinct types, making it impossible to assign them to non-nullable types without an explicit check.
        - `noImplicitAny`: Prevents TypeScript from inferring the any type for variables, ensuring that types are always explicit.
        - `noImplicitThis`: Ensures that this is typed correctly in functions, preventing ambiguous behavior.
        - `alwaysStrict`: Ensures that all files are treated as in strict mode by default.
        - `strictFunctionTypes`: Checks that function parameter types match exactly, preventing common mistakes with function arguments.
    - You can enable strict mode by setting "`strict`": true in the `tsconfig.json` file.

## Senior Level Questions

1. Advanced Generics
- [x] Explain how conditional types work. Provide examples.
    - Conditional types in TypeScript allow you to define types that depend on a condition. They follow this basic syntax:
    ```typescript
    T extends U ? X : Y
    ```
    - This means:
        - If type T extends (or is assignable to) type U, then the type is X.
        - Otherwise, the type is Y.
    - Conditional types are often used for type transformations, where you apply different types based on a certain condition.
    - Example:
    ```typescript
    // Example 1:
    type IsString<T> = T extends string ? 'Yes' : 'No';

    type Result1 = IsString<string>;  // 'Yes'
    type Result2 = IsString<number>;  // 'No'
    // In this example, IsString is a conditional type that returns 'Yes' if T is a string, and 'No' otherwise.

    // Example 2:
    // You can also use infer within conditional types to infer a type from another type.
    type ExtractArrayType<T> = T extends (infer U)[] ? U : T;

    type NumberArray = ExtractArrayType<number[]>;  // number
    type StringArray = ExtractArrayType<string[]>;  // string
    type NotArray = ExtractArrayType<boolean>;  // boolean
    // Here, the ExtractArrayType type extracts the element type of an array type, and if the type T is not an array, it returns the type itself.

    // Example 3:
    type ConditionalUnion<T> = T extends string | number ? 'String or Number' : 'Other';

    type Type1 = ConditionalUnion<string>;  // 'String or Number'
    type Type2 = ConditionalUnion<boolean>;  // 'Other'
    ```

- [x] How do you use keyof, typeof, and in within TypeScript generics?
    - `keyof` Operator:
        - The `keyof` operator in TypeScript is used to get a union type of all keys of an object type. It returns a type representing the set of all property names of the given type.
        ```typescript
        interface Person {
            name: string;
            age: number;
        }

        type PersonKeys = keyof Person;  // 'name' | 'age'
        ```

    - `typeof` Operator:
        - The `typeof` operator is used to obtain the type of a value or expression. It's commonly used to get the type of a variable or object at compile-time, allowing you to reference a type based on a value.
        ```typescript
        const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };

        type PersonType = typeof person;  // { name: string; age: number; }
        ```

    - `in` Operator:
        - The `in` operator in TypeScript is used within mapped types to iterate over all keys of a given type and create a new type based on those keys.
        ```typescript
        type ReadOnlyPerson = {
            readonly [K in keyof Person]: Person[K];
        };

        interface Person {
            name: string;
            age: number;
        }

        const person: ReadOnlyPerson = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
        // person.name = 'Jane';  // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
        ```

2. Advanced Interfaces and Types
- [ ] What are index signatures, and how do you use them?
    - An index signature allows you to define an object type where the keys are not known in advance but follow a specific pattern. This is useful for defining types where keys can be dynamically generated or are not known until runtime.
    ```typescript
    // systax
    { [key: string]: Type }

    // Example:
    interface Dictionary {
        [key: string]: number;
    }

    const scores: Dictionary = {
        math: 95,
        science: 88,
        english: 76,
    };

    ```

3. Advanced Utility Types
- [ ] How do Exclude, Extract, and Omit work in TypeScript?
    - `Exclude`:
        - The `Exclude` utility type constructs a type by excluding from a given type all union members that are assignable to another type. It's often used to remove unwanted types from a union.
        ```typescript
        type A = string | number | boolean;
        type B = Exclude<A, boolean>; // Excludes 'boolean' from A
        // Result: B is 'string | number'
        ```
    - `Extract`:
        - The `Extract` utility type constructs a type by extracting from a given type all union members that are assignable to another type. It's the opposite of `Exclude`.
        ```typescript
        type A = string | number | boolean;
        type B = Extract<A, string | number>; // Extracts 'string | number' from A
        // Result: B is 'string | number'
        ```
    - `Omit`:
        - The `Omit` utility type constructs a type by excluding certain keys from an object type. It's used when you want to remove specific properties from a type.
        ```typescript
        interface Person {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            gender: string;
        }

        type PersonWithoutGender = Omit<Person, 'gender'>;
        // Result: { name: string, age: number }
        ```

- [x] Explain how ReturnType and Parameters utility types work.
    - `ReturnType`:
        - The `ReturnType` utility type extracts and returns the type of the return value of a given function type.
        ```typescript
        function greet(name: string): string {
            return `Hello, ${name}`;
        }

        type GreetReturnType = ReturnType<typeof greet>;
        // Result: GreetReturnType is 'string'
        ```
    - `Parameters`:
        - The `Parameters` utility type extracts and returns a tuple of parameter types of a given function type.
        ```typescript
        function greet(name: string, age: number): string {
            return `Hello, ${name}, you are ${age} years old.`;
        }

        type GreetParameters = Parameters<typeof greet>;
        // Result: GreetParameters is [string, number]
        ```

- [x] How do you use NonNullable and Awaited utility types?
    - `NonNullable`:
        - The `NonNullable` utility type constructs a type by excluding null and undefined from a given type.
        ```typescript
        type A = string | number | null | undefined;
        type B = NonNullable<A>;
        // Result: B is 'string | number'
        ```
    - `Awaited`:
        - The `Awaited` utility type extracts the type of the value that a Promise resolves to. It’s useful when working with async functions and promises.
        ```typescript
        type A = Promise<string>;
        type B = Awaited<A>;
        // Result: B is 'string'
        ```

5. Performance and Optimization
- [ ] How do you handle large TypeScript projects with complex types?
    - `Modularization`: Break down types into smaller, reusable modules. This helps avoid overly complex and nested types in one place.
    - `Use type aliases`: Type aliases can help create more readable and reusable types.
    - `Avoid deep inheritance chains`: Try to use composition over inheritance to reduce complexity.
    - `Use interfaces for public APIs`: Interfaces are generally easier to extend, and they allow better readability for large-scale APIs.
    - `Leverage TypeScript's type inference`: Instead of explicitly typing everything, let TypeScript infer types wherever possible to reduce verbosity.

- [ ] What are some common performance bottlenecks in TypeScript compilation, and how do you mitigate(giảm thiểu) them?
    - `Large project size`: As the number of files grows, compilation time increases.
        - `Mitigation`: Use project references to break down a large project into smaller, more manageable sub-projects. This allows TypeScript to only rebuild the parts of the project that have changed.
    - `Excessive type-checking`: Complex types with a lot of type inference or deep type-checking can slow down compilation.
        - `Mitigation`: Optimize the type definitions by simplifying them or making use of any or unknown when you don't need strong typing in specific cases.
    - `Too many type declarations:` Having large and complex type declaration files or too many d.ts files can cause delays.
        - `Mitigation`: Split type declarations into smaller files and use the skipLibCheck option in the tsconfig.json to skip checking of declaration files.

- [ ] How do you configure TypeScript to optimize for incremental builds?
    - `incremental`: Tells TypeScript to store information about the last build to optimize future builds.
    - `tsBuildInfoFile`: Specifies the file where TypeScript stores this build information. This helps TypeScript avoid recompiling files that haven't changed.
    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "incremental": true,
            "tsBuildInfoFile": "./.tsbuildinfo"
        }
    }
    ```
